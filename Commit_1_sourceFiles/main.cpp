// Game Engine Design - SDL base code, OO version 1
// This sample project makes limited use of OO design, and demonstrates
// use of SDL for window/event management with OpenGL for graphics rendering
// This project requires the following 3rd party libraries:
// - SDL (base libraries)
// - SDL_ttf (to render text to a surface/texture for display in OpenGL)
//
// There remain MANY ways to improve this code, some of which are identified in
// comments, and these are left as an exercise to the reader
